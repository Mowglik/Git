	<h2>Hi, mowglik</h2>	<form method="post" action="userlist.php">
	<h2>Offline rules</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Always use YOUR OWN defensive items/set to be protect in case of 
GVG/PVP attack ; GVG points permit to us to have each week, a bonus day 
for hunting, and too, gvg points are good for getting new epic items</p></li>
<li><p>Always go/return on one of our 2 relics ( depend of your level ) 
to protect/defend it; it give to all of us, big bonus, so, when we loose
 them, it`s cost ton of golds to re-empower them. if you are in 
Xinderoth areas ( lvl 400 to 421 ) you can stay where you are, cause the
 cost of staminas to get back is very high. BUT, if you are everywhere 
else, you should go protect one of our 2 relics ( lvl 113 &amp; lvl 592 )
 ; to see details of our ONLY 2 relics, and how to go on &amp; how to 
come back to hunt, please go on our forum and read this. thank you !:

</ul>

<h2>Guild equipements rules</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>NEVER pull items from someone who is online. Send them a private message first &amp; wait for the positive answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Only pull from the person&#8217;s backpack, &amp; from the Guild Store; <strong>only a Leader can pull equipped gear</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>NEVER go offline with Crystaline gear equipped !  <strong>Crystaline</strong> are very special pieces that have mostly been donated/bought. These pieces are very fragile and if you are caught using them <strong>WITHOUT UNBREAKABLE 190 or better</strong>, the gear will immediately be removed from your character and <strong>you will receive a warning for the first offense</strong>.
<strong>The second offense and you will lose the privilege of recall items for 3 days</strong>. 
<strong>The third offense and you will lose the privilege of recall items for 1 weeks.</strong> Those items can be use for arena, since they don`t lose durability. </p></li>
<li><p>NEVER go offline with Fully Forge gear equipped. You will have your gear removed from your character by a Leader.</p></li>
<li><p>NEVER go offline with Epic gear equipped. Those items are usefull
 for everybody to hunt, GVG, Arena, etc. They are not there to boost 
your staminas gain. You will have your gear removed from your character 
by a Leader. </p></li>
<li><p>NEVER go offline with Guild gear equipped. You will have your gear removed from your character by a Leader.</p></li>
<li><p>ALWAYS return guild`s items to the player you have recalled them, FULL REPAIR !!! </p></li>
<li><p>Do not tag unless asked to hunt for it by a Leader. If you want to donate the set or pieces ask committee first.</p></li>
<li><p>Legendary gear DONATED to the guild will be tagged. These too 
will be for the use of all in the guild and kept in GS or unequipped 
when not in use. </p></li>
<li><p>Super Elite sets DONATED to the guild will be tagged. These too 
will be for the use of all in the guild and kept in GS or unequipped 
when not in use. </p></li>
<li><p>Items that have been fully forged and found to be very useful may
 be tagged after asking the committee Arena stuffs are very welcome too.
 </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Buffs rules</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Buff yourself first before you ask
for a buff.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not ask for buffs you don`t need.</p></li>
<li><p>If you haven`t received the asked
for buffs, go ahead and start
hunting without it, or try finding
someone selling them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No Mass Messages or Private messages
for buffs</strong>, except if people told you
that you can private message them.</p></li>
<li><p>No more than 3 buffs requested, at
the discretion of the buffer, not
mandatory. It means you can ask for
more than 3, but you may only
receive 3.</p></li>
<li><p>No complaining if you do not receive
all the buffs you asked for.</p></li>
<li><p>Always say thank you as your guild
mate has used his/her stamina just
to help you.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We recommand that you get to 4000
stamina fast to maximize your buffs</strong>, except maybe for GVGers</p></li>
<li><p>No specification on the level of the
buff. It`s only extra if you get a
high level.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer your own buffs as well, people
who never buff others can be
excluded from being buffed
themselves. Write your buffs in your
BIO.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Mercenaries rules</h2>

<p>It isn&#8217;t as important as it once was about maintaining gold in the 
guild to hire mercs. However, do be aware that it takes gold to hire 
mercs and it is not there for just 1 or 2 people to use. It would be 
wise to have more people hunting when the hiring of mercs is involved. I
 do realize there are times during the day when it is difficult to find 
enough people online in the guild to get a decent group together. If it 
becomes a problem that 1 or 2 people are hiring mercs just for 
themselves we will discuss the problem with that person at that time. 
Just be aware that mercs can benefit a large amount of people. We need 
to have more merc days. I will leave the coordinating merc days to the 
Internal Affairs Committee for consideration for the future.</p>

<p>Penalties:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>First offense- 1 day in detention</p></li>
<li><p>Second offense- 1 week in detention</p></li>
<li><p>Third offense possibility of being
kicked from the guild. You will need
to get in touch with one the guild
founder</p></li>
</ul>
